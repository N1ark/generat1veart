# generat1veart
Generative Art programs in Java! Some are inspired from inconvergent, check them out!

All pieces are in individual `.java` files, in `pieces/`
To generate one, simply change the line in `Main.java` with the piece you want to generate.
Have fun!
If you create something new, feel free to share it with me :)
